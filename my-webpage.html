            <div style="float: right;"><img src="picture.png" width="150"></div>
            <p>Immersive Exhibits and Narrative: The Apartheid Museum offers visitors a highly immersive and
                thought-provoking experience through its exhibits and narrative. The museum presents the history of
                apartheid chronologically, from its roots in colonialism to its eventual dismantling and the dawn of
                democracy in South Africa.</p>

            <p>Historical Significance: The Market Theatre holds immense historical significance as it emerged
                during the apartheid era in South Africa. Established in 1976 by Mannie Manim and Barney Simon, it
                provided a platform for artists of all races to showcase their work, challenging the racial segregation
                policies of the time.</p>

            <p>Conservation Efforts: Many lion parks play a crucial role in lion conservation efforts. With lion
                populations declining due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching, lion parks often serve
                as sanctuaries or breeding centers for these animals.
